            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TRanÅ¿lations are things very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, eÅ¿pecially where the Notion is uncouth: Yet hath this been my chief inducement to adventure upon this aÅ¿Å¿ay; my aim being to make the Notion familiar, by a tranÅ¿planting into our Native Å¿oile. One thing I am happy in, that I have but one Judge, your Å¿elf; unto whoÅ¿e Å¿enÅ¿e if I have arrived, I have done well, and diÅ¿value the cenÅ¿ure of the Critical world, as incompetent. But be the Author once dead, 'tis leÅ¿s dangerous to put to Å¿ea in an egge-Å¿hel, then TranÅ¿late under the controll and Å¿ubjection of the various Å¿tormy cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ures of each peeviÅ¿h fancy, when the deciÅ¿ive Pole-Å¿tar is hid.</p>
            <p>In the uncaÅ¿ing your Å¿enÅ¿e from the Latine skin, I know you will think I
<pb facs="tcp:57273:3"/>have torne fleÅ¿h and all away. But I muÅ¿t therein be pardoned, becauÅ¿e Å¿ome ExpreÅ¿Å¿ions and Elegancies in it are Å¿o peeviÅ¿h, that they walk dull, heavy, and without grace, when Å¿tript of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive attire, except honoured with a coÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumÅ¿cription; in making of which according to my uÅ¿ual botchery, I have Å¿ometimes hid from your view their moÅ¿t comely parts. For in truth in is very hard to write good <hi>EngliÅ¿h;</hi> and few have attained its height in this laÅ¿t <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>As to the matter and Author of the Teutonick PhiloÅ¿ophy, which you here abbreviate, though you know I alwayes affected it and him, yet durÅ¿t never Å¿aile into the Ocean of his vaÅ¿t Conceits with my little Scull; me thought the reading of him was like the Å¿tanding upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice, or by a Canon Å¿hot off, the waft of them lickt up all my brains.</p>
            <p>I confeÅ¿Å¿e, your <hi>Introduction</hi> hath made me Å¿omething more Å¿teddy, and his Notions more familiar; and I have found Å¿ome inkling of them in Scripture, Å¿o have Å¿haken hands with leÅ¿Å¿e Å¿uÅ¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57273:3"/>
            <p>
               <hi>But may nothing ever appear more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to any man, or fuller of light, then the Å¿weet, humble, contemned life of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour!</hi> Its true, the Å¿acred Writ is not plentifull in delivering the naturall frame and principles of the Soul, though the value of it is Å¿ufficiently laid open by the price payed for its redemption, and the MeÅ¿Å¿enger Å¿ent to Å¿eeke it: So that drop of knowledge may perhaps be reÅ¿erved to make up the full Å¿ea pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿ed theÅ¿e laÅ¿t times. In my opinion, whoever reades this Scheme of the Worlds creation, and birth of the Soul, may make excellent uÅ¿e of it, review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his noble deÅ¿cent from thoÅ¿e eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall EÅ¿Å¿ences, and Å¿hame to bemire him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elfe in that Å¿wine-like refreÅ¿hment of wallowing in cold dirty mire.</p>
            <p>Our noble Genealogy Å¿hould minde us of our Fathers houÅ¿e, make us weary of the tutelage under hairy Faunes and cloven-footed Satyres, the rulers and inÅ¿tructers of our diÅ¿Å¿olute youth, and riper yeares (though clothed by <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mago</hi> in Angelick garment) whoÅ¿e Å¿pell I hope is neer an end, &amp; put on thoughts
<pb facs="tcp:57273:4"/>of eÅ¿cape out of this beaÅ¿tial Å¿lavery, into the Kingdome prepared for us.</p>
            <p>As for this little Determination, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I Å¿ee the fate of it, that it will be thought a fitter Preface to <hi>Ovid's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoÅ¿es,</hi> then an Introduction to any thing that is Å¿erious: Å¿o rude and barbarous is the eÅ¿teem of vulgar men, of any thing beyond their capacity.</p>
            <p>Give me leave to Å¿et forth this one Paradoxe: That the nearer any book or Notion approacheth the Truth, the eaÅ¿iler and with more applauÅ¿e it may be contradicted, becauÅ¿e that in all conteÅ¿t the Vulgar being Judge, (by vulgar I mean the wiÅ¿eones of the world) the appeal is either to ReaÅ¿on, or SenÅ¿e, which are but the rulers and guides of the night, dim lights, Å¿et up far diÅ¿tant from Truths Å¿tately manÅ¿ion, to lead poor groping Å¿ouls in this worlds affairs. The bringing of Truth to their teÅ¿t, is like gold to a candle-light, in which all the impoÅ¿tures that can be named may be hid, maugre its diÅ¿covery. No, it's a due temper of the Soule that muÅ¿t give light to Å¿uch diÅ¿quiÅ¿itions; which only
<pb facs="tcp:57273:4"/>harboureth, acknowledgeth, judgeth, and receives that Å¿priteful vivacious eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ence of Truth. When the law of God hath rub'd off all the Å¿cales of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent from our eyes, then Å¿hall we Å¿ee and judge. <hi>He that doth my words,</hi> (Å¿aith our Saviour) <hi>Å¿hall know whether I Å¿peak of the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CeaÅ¿e Å¿hining, O ye <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon,</hi> and thou Eternal <hi>Archetype</hi> of all light! Vain mortal men have with the Å¿teele and flint of a <hi>Major</hi> and <hi>Minor</hi> Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition Å¿truck out a fire and light directive of you all: This dark lanthorn of a <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiÅ¿tical</hi> deduction, is made paramount to all; all elÅ¿e dim tapers, that are not mov'd in its <hi>Ecliptick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Å¿eems harÅ¿h; but yet if well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved, is a Gangrene Å¿pread through all ChriÅ¿tian religion. I will not Å¿ay it, but it may be it is true, that the rigid addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to this foundation hath nicknam'd many holy truths, and men, that believe God yet to be alive &amp; Å¿peak, and that he hath not forÅ¿aken his Scepter, devolved all the rule of Orphan mankinde to this dangerous vertible principle.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57273:5"/>
            <p>But may that State ever proÅ¿per, whoÅ¿e wiÅ¿e hands mould a generous free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome productive of noble conceits, dreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing a fit Stage for our Saviours Å¿econd coming; who, Å¿hould he come as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to mans power, would be found in the inquiÅ¿ition or under the laÅ¿h of Å¿ome dire Decree; Å¿o all-compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henÅ¿ive and omniÅ¿cient is every preÅ¿ent age of all truth, dividing it from falÅ¿hood to a haire in their grave Councels; with penalty of <hi>huc uÅ¿que &amp; non ultra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return to my Paradox: <hi>EliÅ¿ha</hi>'s Å¿ervant having no other comfort then what humane reaÅ¿on afforded, bemoans his maÅ¿ters certain ruine by the hand of the <hi>AÅ¿Å¿yrians;</hi> The Prophet opens his eyes, he Å¿ees help enough: certainly this was no conjuring trick, nor prophetick viÅ¿ion, but what was reall, though the Å¿ervant Å¿aw it not before.</p>
            <p>But had now Å¿ome great PhiloÅ¿opher and maÅ¿ter of reaÅ¿on, been Å¿tanding by, and a diÅ¿pute inÅ¿tituted betwixt him and the Prophet, concerning the HoÅ¿t and the Chariots, the TownÅ¿emen of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> being Judges, had it not been
<pb facs="tcp:57273:5"/>eaÅ¿ie to have made the Prophet Å¿eem a foole, and the people believe his eyes chim'd? He might have askt where the HoÅ¿t was; and when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet had deÅ¿ign'd the place, the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿opher taking with him a competent number of the by-Å¿tanders, might have gone and Å¿tood in the Å¿ame place, and Å¿ung his triumphal Å¿ong: <hi>Non dantur duo corpora in eodem loco, nec penetratio di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menÅ¿ionum; ergÃ² deceptus es:</hi> with many Å¿uch fine devices; and have tript up the poor Prophets credit, with acclamation of the people. And Å¿uch is and will be the fate of all deep DiÅ¿coveries, and high RepreÅ¿entations, brought before that ignorant Tribunal of SenÅ¿e and Vulgar reaÅ¿on.</p>
            <p>But I am out of my way: Be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor what he will, or his Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e; or yours the PropoÅ¿er: Å¿eeing my ignorance hath Å¿et me far out of the reach of Å¿uch high things, I Å¿hall content my Å¿elf with an uÅ¿uall effect of admiraton, Å¿ilence; rather then approve, or diÅ¿approve: And wiÅ¿h the world would make uÅ¿e of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent rule of Saint. <hi>AuÅ¿tin, <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>t tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu

            <head>To the Right Worthy, the Vice-Chancellour, and the Honourable Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ity of <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">
               <hi>Be health and happineÅ¿Å¿e.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THat I have made bold to take up again, and revive with your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Patronage this Å¿mall work, by this time well nigh dead and buried, expoÅ¿ing it to publique view; we hope, will by you be eÅ¿teemed neither unbeÅ¿eeming your honour, nor beneath our duty.</p>
            <p>Your noble favor and patience, whoÅ¿e Å¿weet company carried me on with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ure through the burdens of that office you were once pleaÅ¿ed to honor me with, and which cheared the delivery of theÅ¿e
<pb facs="tcp:57273:7"/>rugged Notions, Å¿ets me in the debt of infinite obligations; which till I can diÅ¿charge, be pleas'd to accept this Å¿croll of paper as a Bond.</p>
            <p>And truly, while I was thus meditate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e; the report, that theÅ¿e eÅ¿Å¿ayes, and my Å¿elf were by Å¿ome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged both hereticall, added vigour to my firÅ¿t reÅ¿olution; Å¿eeing I muÅ¿t needs eÅ¿teem their opinion, onely a defect of memory and advertency, whom that I might fully Å¿atisfie with all well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, I have Å¿et Pen to Paper, and publiÅ¿hed them in the Å¿ame dreÅ¿Å¿e my memory did then Å¿uggeÅ¿t them to my tongue.</p>
            <p>Now, of the matter let the learned judge: For what concernes my Å¿elfe, I wonder thoÅ¿e good men did not perceive, FirÅ¿t, That I Å¿et before them anothers PhiloÅ¿ophy, not mine owne; Secondly, That my Å¿elfe likewiÅ¿e Å¿tood aloofe from peremptory aÅ¿Å¿ent to Å¿ome of thoÅ¿e things that were delivered; Thirdly, well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing in what uneven way I tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, nor Å¿ufficiently confiding in the Å¿upport of mine owne judgement, I beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,
<pb facs="tcp:57273:7"/>and I hope obtained pardon of all mine errours; which leÅ¿t I Å¿hould faile of in the publication, I have adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Epilogue then uÅ¿ed, which I doubt not but will be Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿efull to both.</p>
            <p>And certainly if pardon belong to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, it is to the Å¿ilent, Å¿olemn Sceptick, whoÅ¿e opinions are not brought forth as the onely heires-male to all humane aÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent, invading the worlds freedom with fire, faggot, and thunder.</p>
            <p>And may I be in the bed-route of thoÅ¿e Seekers, that diÅ¿truÅ¿ting the known and experienced deceits of their owne reaÅ¿on, walk unfetterr'd in the queÅ¿t of truth, with an eaÅ¿ie Å¿uÅ¿pitious gate, not hunting thoÅ¿e poore Å¿oules with Dogge and Speare, whoÅ¿e dimme Å¿ight hath led them into deÅ¿ert and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten paths.</p>
            <p>Certainly, more Å¿oules have crept to the throne of WiÅ¿dome; with the thin-Å¿pun clew of Right-opinion, then ere have drawne her downe with the Å¿tiffe cart-rope of irreÅ¿ragable Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giÅ¿mes.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57273:8"/>
            <p>This Å¿uppoÅ¿ed certain Å¿cience of what is good and right, believe me, (O you noble <hi>Athenians</hi>) is the true <hi>ignis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus,</hi> whoÅ¿e Å¿mal glimmering expires in palpable darkneÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
            <p>Would you Å¿aile in the PhiloÅ¿ophers Ocean; know that two Ilands there are of exceeding danger, yet built upon and inhabited, and defended, as part of the main continent of Truth: The firÅ¿t is called, <hi>I believe as the Church be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth.</hi> Happy men, whom Å¿o eaÅ¿ie la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour hath Å¿et on the Å¿hore of wiÅ¿dome! And happy that narrow point, that hath devoured Å¿o large a circumference! The other is called, <hi>WhatÅ¿oever the Church believes, that will not I believe.</hi> And here they think they are Å¿afe: TheÅ¿e, if all the old HereÅ¿ies were tranÅ¿lated into the Churches Canon; they would leave them, and embrace our relinquiÅ¿h' t faith, crying it up as their great <hi>Diana.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both theÅ¿e rocks I have alwayes Å¿tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouÅ¿ly avoided: The Decrees of the Church, that is, (if I may Å¿peak freely) the prevailing part of the preÅ¿ent Age, were never my <hi>Hercules his pillars,</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:57273:8"/>I thought it unlawfull to look beyond them. I have often read and Å¿mil'd, and Å¿miled and read <hi>Mirandula, GaÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿endus,</hi> and other famous wits of the latter Age, delivering their choice no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diametrically oppoÅ¿ite to the decrees of that Age, with this civil comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Of Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ion to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (which it Å¿eems) diÅ¿proves not a reputed HereÅ¿ie, Å¿o Å¿he wait upon her in the garb of an handmaid.</p>
            <p>NotwithÅ¿tanding, though I doe not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore the unanimous conÅ¿ent of good and pious men; yet I receive it with much reverence, eÅ¿pecially in a Å¿acred matters 'tis neither my fetter, nor my Å¿candal.</p>
            <p>I profeÅ¿Å¿e, I am not of thoÅ¿e that think the myÅ¿teries of Religion may be rudely unraveled, or its publique ProfeÅ¿Å¿ors beÅ¿patter'd with every Parrots tongue; for mine own particular, the Å¿tudies of the divineÅ¿t PhiloÅ¿ophy have Å¿uckt me in from my childe-hood; and for Å¿uch an one, I never eÅ¿teem'd it unlawfull, or diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approved by any Å¿ober man, modeÅ¿tly to to diÅ¿pute, and diÅ¿cuÅ¿Å¿e even the higheÅ¿t matters, eÅ¿pecially in a learned Audito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:57273:9"/>
            <p>As for theÅ¿e notions with which you are preÅ¿ented, you have them not from me as <hi>Sibilline Oracles,</hi> Å¿uch as I ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know or fully believe to be true, nor perhaps ever Å¿hall, till convinced with the Å¿ame light that illuminated the Divine Author: however let them Å¿it among Probables, till He come that Å¿hall come.</p>
            <p>I deny not but that much may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againÅ¿t them, and that not eaÅ¿ily anÅ¿wered; but 'twill befit him that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes this taske, likewiÅ¿e to Å¿et forth another Å¿cheme of the infinite Eternity, and delineation of the <g ref="char:V">Æ²</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿e, in which is no contradictory in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conÅ¿onancy, and neerlier agreeing with the ancienteÅ¿t PhiloÅ¿ophy and Å¿acred Scripture.</p>
            <p>I Å¿peake plainly what I at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent thinke.</p>
            <p>WhatÅ¿oever the Thrice-great <hi>Hermes</hi> deliver'd as Oracles from his Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <hi>Tripos,</hi> or <hi>Pythagoras</hi> Å¿pake by authority, or <hi>Socrates</hi> debated, or <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿totle</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57273:9"/>affirmed; yea, whatever divine <hi>Plato</hi> propheÅ¿ied, or <hi>Plotinus</hi> proved; this, and all this, or a far higher and profounder PhiloÅ¿ophy is (I think) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the <hi>Teutonicks</hi> writings. And if there be any friendly medium which can poÅ¿Å¿ibly reconcile thoÅ¿e ancient dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences between the Nobler WiÅ¿dom which hath fixt her Palace in Holy writ, and her Å¿tubborn hand-maid, Naturall ReaÅ¿on; this happy marriage of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and the Soul, this wonderfull con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of diÅ¿cords in one harmony, we owe in great meaÅ¿ure to <hi>Teutonicus</hi> his skill.</p>
            <p>Onely let not the non or miÅ¿under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tanding even of the moÅ¿t rationall Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (if not a little Å¿ublim'd above the Å¿phere of common reaÅ¿on) be imputed as a fault to this elevated PhiloÅ¿opher, no more then 'twas to the divine <hi>Plotine,</hi> whoÅ¿e higheÅ¿t notions many even of his owne School, after much Å¿tudy, were not able to reach.</p>
            <p>And with this proviÅ¿o, I doubt not but the height of what I here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e, will be abundantly performed by
<pb facs="tcp:57273:10"/>the Authors Book of the <hi>Three Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,</hi> which as I am informed is now at Schoole, and will in few moneths be taught our language.<note n="a" place="bottom">This Book was publiÅ¿hed <hi>Ann.</hi> 1648.</note> In the mean time may your noble favour accept my poor pains in taking off the dark Å¿tyle of the Authors magick language from theÅ¿e abÅ¿truÅ¿e Notions, attiring them in a garbe as Å¿utable to the common eye, as their Å¿trange proportion would be are.</p>
            <p>And you the renowned Youth of both the Schools, the darlings of your times, whoÅ¿e learning, modeÅ¿ty, and piety, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouÅ¿ly unproportioned to your Age, will be an enÅ¿ample to future generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it was for your cauÅ¿e chiefly, that for one night or two, I bade Å¿weet Å¿leep and eaÅ¿e adieu (both at other times very acceptable) that under the protection of the Å¿ilent Moon, I might lead you into the inmoÅ¿t receÅ¿Å¿es of the more Å¿acred Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loÅ¿ophy: To you my deareÅ¿t fellow-Å¿tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents (your high merit challenging no leÅ¿Å¿e) is this <hi>Enchiridion</hi> principally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O Knowlege in the world hath more attendant difficulties, then that of our Å¿elvs; ThoÅ¿e Å¿lie Å¿piri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall EÅ¿Å¿ences being too Å¿ubtile for the SenÅ¿es anatomy. Hence is it, that both PhiloÅ¿ophers and Divines, in their dark con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teÅ¿ts, have as yet fill'd the world onely with doubts concerning the Original of the humane and immortal Soule, and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the mortal Body.</p>
            <p>The variety of diÅ¿Å¿enting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions (to Å¿peak in a PhyÅ¿ical Å¿enÅ¿e) comes little Å¿hort of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitude<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> Nor is there Å¿carce that conÅ¿iderable part of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures large circumference to be ramed, which hath not been
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57273:15"/>thought a worthy material, by Å¿ome tume-Å¿ick brain, to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out into a Soule.</p>
            <p>But I will not trouble you with a Relation of the many Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral gueÅ¿Å¿es of doting Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; Å¿ome of which, to our preÅ¿ent Age, will Å¿eem to be dreams and fancies riÅ¿en from the groÅ¿Å¿e vapours of over-fed bodies.</p>
            <p>The more Å¿elect are theÅ¿e five, which I Å¿hall Å¿et down in order.</p>
            <p>The firÅ¿t is attributed to the ancient PhyÅ¿ician <hi>Galen,</hi> (with whom I believe the Sadduces agree) who (it Å¿eems aiming to bring Å¿oul as wel as body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the dominion of his ProfeÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion) affirms that the Å¿oul, as of men, Å¿o of bruit beaÅ¿ts, is a meer due temper or active Å¿pirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riÅ¿ing
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57273:15"/>from the commixture of Elements and Humours, and mortal, with their diÅ¿Å¿oluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>The Å¿econd is, of certain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Arabians,</hi> and of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Cardane;</hi> which is, That all Particular Å¿oules are but the emanation of the UniverÅ¿al Å¿oule of the world; or rather, that there are no particular Å¿oules at all, but that the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿al Spirit neceÅ¿Å¿arily enacts all matter duly prepared for life; which it can no more Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tract from it, then the Sun can bridle its beames, or divert its light from rendring a perÅ¿picu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body tranÅ¿lucid.</p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e two opinions are main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained either by Epicures, or as the ApoÅ¿tle calls them, men
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57273:16"/>without God in the world; the folly of which, not onely our Religion, but the joint-conÅ¿ent of the wiÅ¿er Heathens hath rejected.</p>
            <p>The third is that of the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonicks,</hi> who affirm the Earth on which we now live, not to be our native Å¿oile; and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which we weare, to be fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of our Å¿lavery, enÅ¿ignes and badges of our tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion, to which our Å¿oules are confin'd for offences committed of old againÅ¿t their Creatour: That being all of them created by God in an equal and immacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late eÅ¿tate, of rare perfection, the fountain &amp; firmament of which being coaduntion with the will of God, they fell to their own will, and by that meanes were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57273:16"/>caÅ¿t out from the preÅ¿ence of God, and confin'd to this world; in which, if under the dire School-miÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿e of miÅ¿eries, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conÅ¿tancies, miÅ¿chances, morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, they learned to reÅ¿eek that Eternal Immoveable, they are by the mercy of God reaÅ¿Å¿umed into their own Country, being unchained from the gally of the Body.</p>
            <p>This opinion is maintained by <hi>Hermes, Plato, Iamblichus, Plo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus,</hi> and by the whole School of the myÅ¿tical PhiloÅ¿ophy, and as I gueÅ¿Å¿e, believed by moÅ¿t of the ancient and late Jewes, and in our ChriÅ¿tian Schools by the famous <hi>Origen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NotwithÅ¿tanding, Å¿ome of that way do in this differ from the generality, That they Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57273:17"/>all the legion of Å¿ouls were not partakers in the tranÅ¿greÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion, but are Å¿ome in every Age Å¿ent down into undefiled bodies by divine diÅ¿penÅ¿ation, as guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, inÅ¿tructers, and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the captived Å¿oules into their ancient inheritance and loÅ¿t freedome. But that thoÅ¿e Å¿oules whom the hard apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip and Å¿ervitude under things mortal, finite, empty, dark, could not Å¿tirre to a deÅ¿ire and preparation to things eternal, immenÅ¿e, and infinite; thoÅ¿e are either winnowed over again in humane bodies, or deÅ¿cend into irrationality, and are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with bodies Å¿uitable to their groveling minds, and after fall down into plants, till at laÅ¿t they vaniÅ¿h into their firÅ¿t nothing.</p>

            <p>But Å¿urely this opinion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withÅ¿tanding its glorious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, and that it hath Å¿pirit and light in it beÅ¿eeming thoÅ¿e Heroick wits that brought it forth; yet to us ChriÅ¿tians that have freed our underÅ¿tandings by a voluntary captivity to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writ, which delivereth to us mans firÅ¿t creation, his fall, and the contagion on his whole progenie; Adde alÅ¿o the bodies reÅ¿urrection, its union again with the Å¿oule, and everlaÅ¿ting puniÅ¿hment in hell-fire for the wicked: TheÅ¿e, I Å¿ay, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿idered to be in an exact oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition, we will without further examination bury it with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as the beÅ¿t and nobleÅ¿t EÅ¿Å¿ay natural man hath attained unto.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:57273:18"/>
            <p>The fourth is maintained by the greateÅ¿t part of the Divines in ChriÅ¿tendome, and is, That the Å¿oule of man, immediately upon the compleating of all the parts of the body, at leaÅ¿t thoÅ¿e of abÅ¿olute uÅ¿e, is created of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and in the inÅ¿tant of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation infus'd into the body.</p>
            <p>The fifth, Å¿eems to be the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the learned <hi>ReÅ¿pondent,</hi> yet without any impetuous diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>approbation of the former; with whom many famons Wits of this Age do concurre, nor doth it want Å¿ome approbation from reputed Antiquity. And thus they deliver it: That the humane Å¿oul of the Infant hath its original from the Parents Å¿eed.</p>
            <p>Now which of theÅ¿e be trucÅ¿t,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57273:18"/>no demonÅ¿trable ReaÅ¿on hath yet decided. At this preÅ¿ent time with the favour of the Noble Auditors, we Å¿hall caÅ¿t anchor upon neither, but in a free diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿Å¿ion Å¿ound each its bottome.</p>
            <p>The grounds they build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are taken either from the Å¿a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, or principles of PhiloÅ¿ophy: the latter I Å¿hall omit, as having cleerly been diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuÅ¿s'd by the acuteneÅ¿Å¿e and judgment of the late DiÅ¿putants; and for the authorities taken from Sacred writ, I Å¿hall weigh them in the balance of theÅ¿e two Å¿mall ConcluÅ¿ions.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, that nothing is either Å¿o peremptorily or plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in Sacred writ, in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of either opinion, that it excludes the queÅ¿tion from all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57273:19"/>further debate, or renders the favourers of either opinion He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical or unbelieving.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that all the places of Scripture ingenuouÅ¿ly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together, give more Å¿trong evidence and authority to the maintainers of the Soules deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from the loines of the Parent, then to thoÅ¿e that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that God is immediately aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tant to the production of every <hi>Individuall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TheÅ¿e two concluÅ¿ions I Å¿hall joyntly proÅ¿ecute.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1.] That then which meets us in the firÅ¿t place, <hi>viz.</hi> That in the beginning of the Worlds creation, we finde the Earth and Water made the firÅ¿t Mother and NurÅ¿e of all inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our living Å¿oules, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57273:19"/>word of the Almighty; but God himÅ¿elf declared the Father of mans Å¿oule, in giving him life by the divine efflux of his breath.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AnÅ¿.</hi> 1.] This, if urged for the firÅ¿t fountain of mans Å¿oule, hath Å¿ome weight in it; but no deductive evidence to exempt the humane off-Å¿pring from Å¿elf-multiplication or Å¿eed in it Å¿elf, with which God endued all kindes of life beÅ¿ides; nay, rather it is from the Epilogue of the Creation otherwiÅ¿e evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>[IncreaÅ¿e and multiply]</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which command <hi>Adam</hi> and his ConÅ¿ort were expreÅ¿Å¿ely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded; and in the proceÅ¿Å¿e of the Å¿tory, it is declared, <hi>Adam</hi> did fulfill that command, and begot a Son in his own Image;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:57273:20"/>and afterwards Å¿eventie Soules are Å¿aid to have iÅ¿Å¿ued out of <hi>Jacobs</hi> loins.</p>
            <p>But I am not ignorant, that the word Soule in Scripture, is of very ambiguous interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor is alwayes Å¿ignificant of that Å¿uperiour part, of which the queÅ¿tion is Å¿tated: but is Å¿ometimes uÅ¿ed for fleÅ¿h and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as in the 21. of <hi>Leviticus, [He Å¿hall not come at a dead Å¿oule,]</hi> (Å¿o runs the Original expreÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion) yet moÅ¿t generally it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noteth the Soule and its affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or the intire perÅ¿on made up of the Å¿oule and body joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: but that in this place it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿ignifieth the Soule, I am hence convinced.</p>
            <p>In the compariÅ¿on and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of ChriÅ¿ts PrieÅ¿thood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:57273:20"/>the Levitical, the ApoÅ¿tles proofs are thus; that <hi>Levi</hi> in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s loins paid tithes to <hi>MelchiÅ¿edeck.</hi> If here the Å¿oule of <hi>Levi</hi> be not jointly meant, the argument deÅ¿troyes it Å¿elf: for the body likewiÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿t was in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s loins, and paid tithes to <hi>MelchiÅ¿edeck,</hi> whereby the preheminence would ceaÅ¿e; and as for conviction from the argument, the two PrieÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods remain Å¿till in equall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
            <p>But I return whence I Å¿traied. God in the beginning, is Å¿uppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed by an immediate preÅ¿ence to have applyed himÅ¿elf not onely to the framing of mans Å¿oule, but the kneading of his body too: but Å¿ince that time, it is confeÅ¿Å¿ed, he hath delivered the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57273:21"/>worke of the body to mediate inÅ¿truments. How invalid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is that argument of Gods immediate aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tance to the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of the original piece, to evince Å¿o cloÅ¿e an aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿ting to the production of al Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ive Å¿ouls?</p>
            <p>The Earth likewiÅ¿e in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning brought forth every BeaÅ¿t and Plant; the Water, FiÅ¿h, and Fowl: but now both Earth and water have ceaÅ¿ed teeming, and the whole Creation moves into infinite particulars, by the inexhauÅ¿tible force of multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation infuÅ¿ed into the Earth's and Waters firÅ¿t fry, by God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. Be it therefore far from us, to think that the manner and circumÅ¿t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>AnÅ¿. ad</hi> 3.] For the firÅ¿t Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, if no GoÅ¿pel had been, nor our Saviours diÅ¿pute with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> recorded by Holy writ, wherein that deep point of Regeneration is opened, and the relation of our Å¿oul's Å¿on-Å¿hip to God, that Scripture had had Å¿ome difficulty in it: but our Å¿econd birth is there clearly intended, in which Å¿enÅ¿e God is frequenlty called our Father, we his Sons, a new creature, born not of fleÅ¿h and blood, or by mans carnall affection, but by the will of God: and me thinks, that from theÅ¿e very Scriptures wee may elicite no contemptible deduction in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Souls proceÅ¿Å¿e from the viÅ¿ible Parent; arguing, That the Å¿ubject of generation and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation

But it will be Å¿aid (without violence to Scripture) that all Å¿ouls return to God, Å¿eated in his Å¿everal thrones of judgment and mercy; to Gods love, or wrath; yet both to God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>AnÅ¿. ad</hi> 4.] What the return of the Å¿oul to God is, with the manner of it, I Å¿hall at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ent make no curious diÅ¿quiÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57273:24"/>But as to the purpoÅ¿e why this place is urged, I propoÅ¿e this more genuine interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>[The Å¿pirit Å¿hall return to him that gave it]</hi> (that is) to the firÅ¿t Author of that divine particle of breath inÅ¿pired to our firÅ¿t Father. And that this place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the firÅ¿t original of mans Å¿oule, and not all Å¿ucceeding, that place in <hi>Zachary</hi> makes it very evident, where the effor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the humane Å¿pirit is joined with the coagulation of the earth, and expanÅ¿ion of the heavens. <hi>[Thus Å¿aith the Lord which Å¿tretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the Å¿pirit of man within him.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this very Å¿enÅ¿e we are frequently called in Holy Writ
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57273:24"/>duÅ¿t and aÅ¿hes; and yet from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> untill this time, fleÅ¿h hath begot fleÅ¿h.</p>
            <p>Therefore the application muÅ¿t neceÅ¿Å¿arily be, either to the ultimate terme of reÅ¿olution, or firÅ¿t matter of our bodies exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tence.</p>
            <p>There remains one place of Scripture, which is the Å¿word and Å¿peare of thoÅ¿e that defend the continued creation of Å¿ouls: and it is in the 21. of <hi>Exod. v.</hi> 22. the Septuagint render the place thus: <q>
                  <hi>[If a man Å¿mite a woman, and the fruit come from her unfaÅ¿hion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Å¿miter Å¿hall onely undergoe Å¿uch a mulct as the womans huÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Å¿hall Å¿et down: but if it come from her formed, Å¿oule Å¿hall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for Å¿oule.</hi>

            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:57273:25"/>
            <p>Hence (Å¿ay they) it is evident, that the Å¿oul comes not into the body, till it have forme and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hion befitting Å¿uch a gueÅ¿t, and therefore not tranÅ¿mitted from the Parent, but firÅ¿t created, and then infuÅ¿ed.</p>
            <p>But certainly that argument bears neither weapon of offence nor defence: For be the Å¿oule either Gods immediate off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pring, or iÅ¿Å¿ue of an inferiour agent; maintain but no actual exiÅ¿tence before the completion of at leaÅ¿t the vital parts, the crime of murder ariÅ¿eth equally from both opinions.</p>
            <p>Some, to fill up the number, are pleaÅ¿ed further to argue, Gods being yet buÅ¿ied in the creation of Å¿oules; from thoÅ¿e words of ChriÅ¿t related by St.

            <p>Thus far haue Authorities of Holy Writ been examined: one Argument remains thought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable, drawn jointly from PhiloÅ¿ophy and Divinity, by

The mothers Å¿olely all reject: If only the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, it had been as good man had been alone: If both, then is the Å¿oule a compound, diviÅ¿ible, mortal: beÅ¿ides, if either both, or the paternal Å¿olely, from whence Å¿hall ChriÅ¿ts Å¿oul be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, who had no mortal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And then by what rules of the Traduciaries PhiloÅ¿ophy Å¿hall we call ChriÅ¿t true man?</p>
            <p>But let us retort this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Å¿o we Å¿hall Å¿oon finde that it hath more noiÅ¿e then force: change but the term of Body for Soule, and I Å¿hall
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:57273:26"/>point the argument, as Å¿harp for our own purpoÅ¿e.</p>
            <p>The body of man is either of paternal or maternal Å¿eed, or of both: none entitles the Mother Å¿olely; if onely the Father, or or both, whence was ChriÅ¿ts body, who had no humane Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; or, how is he truly man? So the infuÅ¿iaÅ¿ts muÅ¿t either leave this argument, or let the Body alÅ¿o partake in their high pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of immediate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But as to thoÅ¿e things which concern the PerÅ¿on of ChriÅ¿t, the Scripture poÅ¿eth mankinde with an explanation of his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration: His Birth, Life and Death, being a Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿ive miracle, <hi>A God born, a man not begotten, a Virgin-Mother, the God of Life

            <p>All which conÅ¿idered, though they are a Å¿ufficient confutation of the laÅ¿t recited argument, and exempt his birth from the Laws of inferiour creatures: yet to make the buÅ¿ines more perÅ¿picu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I Å¿hall propoÅ¿e theÅ¿e three things.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, Though we determine that all Soules have a naturall production; yet we may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any inconÅ¿iÅ¿tence, exempt the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd <hi>Adam:</hi> nor let any man wonder, that we here Å¿lip the cover from <hi>Prince Arthur</hi>'s Shield; Å¿ince <hi>Gigantick</hi> inÅ¿tances are introduced, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rule
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:57273:27"/>the ordinary meaÅ¿ures and proportions of the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of man-kinde.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We affirm, that if Souls be proceeds from viÅ¿ible agents, no valid objection hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders us from determining the original Å¿olely from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Å¿eed; yet with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceÅ¿Å¿ion, that the concourÅ¿e of the woman is of abÅ¿olute neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ity to elicite from man the vital ferment, and to Å¿ubÅ¿tantiate it into viÅ¿ible exiÅ¿tence; which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiÅ¿e would participate of the lot of the three miÅ¿carrying handfuls of Å¿eed, mentioned by our Saviour, that brought no fruit to perfection: Adding fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, That the mother is not much more aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿tant to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of living Souls, then the

            <p>Thirdly, For thoÅ¿e Bug-bears of DiviÅ¿ibility and Mortality, that would haunt the poor Soul, if the father and mother were joint Parents of it; that cauÅ¿eth to Å¿ound reaÅ¿on no matter of fear, Å¿o long as we free them from the power of any natural agent to reduce that poÅ¿Å¿ibility into act, Å¿ubmitting it onely to the benigne Å¿trength of Gods omnipotency.</p>
            <p>Thus farre in favour of Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction is Å¿ufficient: One word concerning Creation of the Soule: for, when, what a Soule is, and what Creation is, is well underÅ¿tood, <hi>The night is paÅ¿t, and the day will appear.</hi>

            <p>'Tis therefore carefully to be obÅ¿erved, that in every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture partaking of that which we properly call Intellect, whether Man or Angel, there are three eÅ¿Å¿entiall parts; <hi>Spirit, Soul</hi> and <hi>Body;</hi> the diÅ¿tinction of which might evidently be made ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, by reaÅ¿on and Å¿acred Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loÅ¿ophy, if we were not pin-folded within Å¿et limits of time.</p>
            <p>By the Spirit, here, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand not that common tye of the Body and the Soul; but the Å¿upreme region of man, or that divine principle, by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which we have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿hip with God: nor by the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that unprofitable carcaÅ¿Å¿e, but a concrete notion of the groÅ¿s Å¿pirits of Å¿enÅ¿e and vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:57273:29"/>And by the Soule, (if we we may Å¿peak as things are) I underÅ¿tand that middle EÅ¿Å¿ence, placed betwixt that heavenly, and that brutal Å¿pirit: but in this preÅ¿ent controverÅ¿ie, the word Soule comprehends a Hotch-potch of all theÅ¿e; and all that is purely oppoÅ¿ed to the Body, is in this controverÅ¿ie cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Soul.</p>
            <p>As for the notion of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that which the Schoolmen and their followers obtrude up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, [<hi>viz.</hi> that 'tis a framing of Å¿omething out of nothing] wants both truth and reaÅ¿on to Å¿upport it; for the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap> in the original tongue and holy writ, from whence the word Creation was firÅ¿t taken up, hath no Å¿uch Å¿ignification; but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:57273:29"/>eternall; to wit, God, and the great deep; that is to Å¿ay, an infinite immeaÅ¿urable Å¿pace, in every imaginable point whereof dwelt the whole Deity.</p>
            <p>Secondly, This Deep, or more truly called <hi>Å¿pace-infinite,</hi> in all dimenÅ¿ions, is not purely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; Å¿eeing two points divers from each other, might in it be aÅ¿Å¿igned, in which God was able to create Å¿o many worlds; and a line extended from the one to the other would a be meaÅ¿ure of the diÅ¿tance of one from the other: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this Å¿pace be not quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity particularly determinate; yet Å¿eeing that of two lines drawn in it, that is to be Å¿aid the longer, that takes up more
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:57273:30"/>parts of this Deep: from hence it may challenge all the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of quantity and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menÅ¿ion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Although that this bottomleÅ¿Å¿e ImmenÅ¿urable par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take (next under God) moÅ¿t highly of the reality of being, yet is it not God himÅ¿elf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauÅ¿e its diviÅ¿ibility and Å¿everall other properties are diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoÅ¿ite to the many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of the perfect Divine life and eÅ¿Å¿ence; And therefore in an apt Å¿ignification it may be termed the Body of the Deity, or more fitly, the eternal habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Godhead.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, To this Deep or AbyÅ¿Å¿e may be attributed all what the PhiloÅ¿ophers aÅ¿cribe to their <hi>Materia Prima,</hi> to wit,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57273:30"/>that it is neither <hi>quid, quantum,</hi> nor <hi>quale;</hi> to wit, none of theÅ¿e in a definite eÅ¿Å¿ence or tircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿crib'd figure or Å¿hape, but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately all.

            </p>
            <p>Of all theÅ¿e properties of the eternall AbyÅ¿Å¿e, I can with eaÅ¿e make a viÅ¿ible reÅ¿emblance, in the conflict of Mettals, with Waters corroÅ¿ive, eÅ¿pecially in the diÅ¿Å¿olution of Iron with the oyle of Vitriol, or in the coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of the oyle of Vitriol by Iron; for the worke is one and the Å¿ame.</p>

               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:57273:31"/>begins to worke to a Å¿weet em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement of each other, and marriage into one body; but almoÅ¿t in the very Å¿ame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ariÅ¿eth another furious force impatient of this union and incorporation, ejecting both water and oyle with Å¿ud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den violence over the brim of the higheÅ¿t Cucurbit; and from this conflict of the conÅ¿trictive power with the contrary Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a third force ariÅ¿eth, which grates thoÅ¿e hard filings of Iron into a Å¿oft and tender ChryÅ¿tal; and fourthly, followeth that darke fire without chearing light, yet Å¿enÅ¿ible by the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous hand of him that dares touch the glaÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
            <p>WhoÅ¿oever Å¿hall curiouÅ¿ly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this combate, may well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57273:32"/>the hideous Å¿tormes of the vaÅ¿t Ocean, depainted to the moÅ¿t exact poÅ¿Å¿ibility of Å¿o Å¿mall an Epitome, and Å¿melling thoÅ¿e rancid fumes diÅ¿perÅ¿ed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the roome (Å¿uch as are Å¿aid in the <hi>ApocalypÅ¿e</hi> to aÅ¿cend from the bottomleÅ¿Å¿e pit) belcht out from this whirpoole, I believe he Å¿hall need no further illuÅ¿tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Poets <hi>Tartarus,</hi> or the ChriÅ¿tians <hi>Hell;</hi> having with Å¿ome difficulty eÅ¿caped Å¿tifling, with overlooking this Å¿o well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limb'd a Breviate. And to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my thoughts plainly, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that part of this great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byÅ¿Å¿e from whence God Å¿hall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire himÅ¿elfe within his own Center, to be truly Hell; but do not believe, that before the fall of <hi>Lucifer</hi> it did break forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57273:32"/>its helliÅ¿h actuality, but was Å¿o becalm'd by the benigne ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the all-preÅ¿ent Deity, that it greatly further'd the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeÅ¿tation of the eternal God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</p>
            <p>Fifthly; Out of the friendly wreÅ¿tling of the beams flowing from the Center of the Deity, and the properties of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ImmenÅ¿e or AbyÅ¿Å¿e, there ariÅ¿eth (let the Reader under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tand that our expreÅ¿Å¿ions deÅ¿ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native of a time, muÅ¿t be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood from all eternity) a <hi>maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tatick light</hi> filling all this infinite Å¿pace; A Å¿light reÅ¿emblance of which we may perceive in our fire; which when it hath dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ted the darkneÅ¿Å¿e of its nouriÅ¿h<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, triumphs in a radiant flame, having wrought through
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57273:33"/>the clung priÅ¿on of dark mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>This light, or at leaÅ¿t its vital and chearing rayes breathing a Å¿weet gale through the circuit of the infinite AbyÅ¿Å¿e, the holy Scripture, eÅ¿pecially the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal book of <hi>Solomon</hi> called by the name of <hi>WiÅ¿dome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly; Hence it may truly be affirmed, that there was from all eternity, is, and Å¿hall be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine World, whoÅ¿e omnipreÅ¿ent Center is the Eternall Unity, whoÅ¿e body and Å¿oule is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byÅ¿Å¿e, and its Å¿pirit is the divine WiÅ¿dome it Å¿elf, born of God the everlaÅ¿ting Father, and of its mother the AbyÅ¿Å¿e; by which name I underÅ¿tand not any of the Divine Attributes, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain EÅ¿Å¿ence on all parts eternal,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57273:33"/>living, intelligent, inferior only in dignity to the eternal Unity, from whence this divine world hath all its ornament and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and in which as in a glaÅ¿Å¿e God hath from all eternity had a lively and moÅ¿t delightful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿pect of his own lovely viÅ¿age, and incomprehenÅ¿ible beauty.</p>
            <p>And now I deÅ¿ire the Auditors would attend whither all theÅ¿e notions carry them. We have hitherto explained the firÅ¿t two Principles only: by the firÅ¿t, I underÅ¿tand the eternall AbyÅ¿Å¿e; by the Å¿econd, the WiÅ¿dome, Å¿uch as we have clearly deÅ¿cribed.</p>
            <p>From theÅ¿e two principles it pleaÅ¿ed the higheÅ¿t Creator, after infinite revolutions of Eternity, to create another world, to wit, the Angelical, diÅ¿tinguiÅ¿hed into
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57273:34"/>three Regions, like a neÅ¿t of Å¿pheres, whoÅ¿e inhabitants were Angels, Å¿evered into three Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchies. The middle, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿t of Light which is now our World, was the habitation of Lucifer and his Angels; whoÅ¿e Souls and Bodies, as likewiÅ¿e of all other Angels, were from the AbyÅ¿Å¿e; their Spirit, from the fruitfull womb of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal WiÅ¿dome.</p>
            <p>This Lucifer, beautifulleÅ¿t of all the reÅ¿t, and who reÅ¿embled (after whoÅ¿e Image, its like, he was made) the Son of God, with his Legions: contemning the Milk of Gods divine BreaÅ¿t, which was ordained to be the food and Å¿upport of his Å¿pirit; by an enormous appetite look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed downward, for the Å¿uÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57273:34"/>of his life, to the menÅ¿tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous efflux of the NurÅ¿e and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his two inferiour Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, whereby his minde and will was choaked, and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelick wings lim'd in unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable mire. By this means, the Spirit of WiÅ¿dome, whoÅ¿e Å¿weet rayes before had temper'd the bitter corroÅ¿ions of the foure properties of the <hi>Matrix,</hi> being Å¿tifled and extinct, the Å¿ore-recited properties of the AbyÅ¿Å¿e budded forth and flouriÅ¿hed in their naturall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, by whoÅ¿e dark and filthy fumes thoÅ¿e proud Spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intoxicated, fell then, and Å¿till fall, (being in a bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leÅ¿Å¿e) into this following irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable condition.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, A deÅ¿ire to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57273:35"/>the beauty of all the other Hierarchies; yea, of the whole Deity to themÅ¿elves. This ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the contractive and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulative power of the AbyÅ¿Å¿e.</p>
            <p>Secondly, To aÅ¿pire beyond the limits of the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to erect themÅ¿elves a Throne in the HigheÅ¿t, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might Å¿ubject God and all their fellow-creatures to a footÅ¿toole of their feet.</p>
            <p>This deÅ¿ire began from the Å¿econd Property, which vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently reÅ¿iÅ¿ts Coagulation or Confinement, and whoÅ¿e mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are alwaies from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Circumference; for they Å¿corned to be pin-folded within the created Spheres, but would make themÅ¿elves in all points equall to the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57273:35"/>immenÅ¿e and infinite Creator.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, When this violent riÅ¿ing received a check by the limits wherein God had Å¿et all created Being; there aroÅ¿e from the aforenam'd Properties, a Å¿pirit of anguiÅ¿h and envy, gnawing it Å¿elf.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laÅ¿tly, broke forth that Å¿moldering heat of darke fire; whoÅ¿e proud force filled all their Region with flames and Å¿moak, and Å¿ulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous tempeÅ¿t.</p>
            <p>And here you may Å¿ee the firÅ¿t originall of Å¿inne, and Hell-fire; eÅ¿pecially thoÅ¿e foure BaÅ¿es, or corner-Å¿tones upon which 'tis founded; <hi>CovetouÅ¿nes, Pride, Envy,</hi> and <hi>Wrath;</hi> For from theÅ¿e apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tate Souls the Å¿pirit had retired to its manÅ¿ion. God had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57273:36"/>drawn himÅ¿elf to his own Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; the WiÅ¿domes Å¿weet light becalm'd the raging Deep, or properties of the AbyÅ¿Å¿e, no more: and what now remains, but that theÅ¿e unhappy bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches fallen from that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the Divine Å¿tock, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their own Å¿phere, the eternal fewel of the fire them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elves have kindled.</p>
            <p>And now at laÅ¿t, not without much toile under the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of expreÅ¿Å¿ing theÅ¿e unheard of Notions, we are arriv'd at a known Land, deÅ¿crib'd ofold by the Poets, to wit, the <hi>Chaos;</hi> the ancienteÅ¿t terme from whence they deduce all their Å¿tory: really, no figment, but a true adumbration of the top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ie-turvie Regiment of Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57273:36"/>Lucifer in this mundane Å¿pace, before this new Creation. And we may well Å¿uppoÅ¿e, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>t by the Å¿trength of this venome, (the fel force of which we feel in our Å¿elves) the other Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies had Å¿oon been infected, had not Gods Å¿eaÅ¿onable right arme check't this <hi>magick</hi> va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour.</p>
            <p>For the Eternal Father, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that Å¿o large a Å¿pace, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tined above the reÅ¿t for a Å¿eat of glory, Å¿hould eternally be bereft of his good influence; and himÅ¿elf fruÅ¿trate of his bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full purpoÅ¿e to communicate happineÅ¿Å¿e to Å¿o many creatures on this Å¿tage, applied himÅ¿elf by his powerfull word to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaÅ¿e theÅ¿e tumults, (that is) created this Å¿enÅ¿ible World out
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57273:37"/>of that diÅ¿ordered heap.</p>
            <p>And firÅ¿t of all, He digeÅ¿ted thoÅ¿e particles or atoms of craÅ¿s matter (congealed by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tringing force of the AbyÅ¿Å¿e) into one body, or (if we may Å¿peak with the <hi>Copernicans</hi>) into Å¿everall opake Å¿pheres, Å¿epara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them from the fluid matter: and this is called in Scripture, the Creation of Heaven &amp; Earth. Then proceeding, he gathered the darkneÅ¿Å¿e which was diÅ¿perÅ¿t through the whole Luciferian region, together with its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, into a narrow compaÅ¿Å¿e, framing thereof a Å¿tiffe dungeon for a receptacle of their all-comprehending Pride. And this in Scripture is called the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Light, and the work of the firÅ¿t day. And this was the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57273:37"/>firÅ¿t victory over <hi>Lucifer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would take up too much time to recite all the degrees of conqueÅ¿t: but it is moÅ¿t cleare by the Å¿eries of divine Å¿tory, that the holy Spirit of God deÅ¿iÅ¿ted not from his conflict with this <hi>Chaos,</hi> before it had perfected an abÅ¿olute victory, and overcome all the enflamed dark matter, captivating it to Å¿ome peculiar uÅ¿e Å¿ubÅ¿ervient to the neceÅ¿Å¿ities or ornament of this world, the temple and habitation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>And it is worthy our obÅ¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that God, after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of every dayes work, did with the whole Quire of Angels Å¿ing a triumphant Å¿ong over the Å¿poils of repulÅ¿ed Hell; of which himÅ¿elfe beares witneÅ¿Å¿e in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57273:38"/>book of <hi>Job.</hi> And it is probable that the Seventh day being the utter Å¿ubduing of the Luciferian tyrannie, rendred that day a day of Å¿ongs and jubilation to all created beings. And although what I am about to Å¿ay, will be received with deriÅ¿ion; yet I Å¿hall utter my thoughts with freedome, to wit, That the 148. PÅ¿alm, and the 104. were in the Å¿eventh day, that great day of triumph, (and perhaps in all Å¿ucceeding Sabbaths) carol'd out by the Angels, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards dictated to the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that Gods will might be done on earth, as it is in heaven. But if the naming of <hi>IÅ¿rael,</hi> and other expreÅ¿Å¿ions of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in theÅ¿e PÅ¿alms, Å¿hould be to any man an occaÅ¿ion of the
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57273:38"/>diÅ¿reliÅ¿h of this opinion; Let that man know, that there was an <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> in Heaven, before <hi>Jacob</hi> was borne; and a Tabernacle, from whence <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi>-his was co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied out: And who-Å¿o reads the Song of the Angels at our Saviour ChriÅ¿ts birth, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares it with <hi>Davids</hi> PÅ¿alms, he will judge them both compoÅ¿ed for one Quire, and Å¿ent down from thence to be learnt by thoÅ¿e holy Å¿ouls which Å¿hal be thought worthy to aÅ¿Å¿iÅ¿t that MuÅ¿ick.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But this is but a Notion</hi> en paÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ant: <hi>I return to the matter in hand</hi> You had before a delineation of the two firÅ¿t Principles: and now out of what hath been laÅ¿t delivered, you may frame to your Å¿elves a definition of the third Principle.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:57273:39"/>
            <p>For under that name I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Spirit, and Body, yea the whole Compages of this our late created Å¿enÅ¿ible world. And now as I conceive, it Å¿uf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently appeareth, that Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not out of nothing; and you likewiÅ¿e underÅ¿tand what I mean by the Three Principles; the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd of which, namely the <hi>AbyÅ¿Å¿e,</hi> and the <hi>WiÅ¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> are on all parts eternal, and all things proceeding from them are finally eternal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal; but what proceeds or is created out of the third Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, is as it Å¿elf, frail and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That I may therefore touch the matter at laÅ¿t, at which all theÅ¿e No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are levelled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the region of <hi>Lucifer</hi> was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57273:39"/>again made habitable, and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated into Å¿ublunary darknes; it Å¿eemed good to the Creatour to create in his place another <hi>Hierarch,</hi> who with his numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous progenie might people this Region, the dominion and poÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion whereof, the former by his tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ion had forfeited. And that was <hi>Adam;</hi> who though in reference to the predominant part of his compoÅ¿ition, he he called Earth of Earth, yet it is very probable that every one of the Elements yielded of its fineÅ¿t parts, to the compoÅ¿ure of Å¿o goodly a Fabrick.</p>
            <p>But whether in the begining, his body were Å¿o groÅ¿Å¿e &amp; dark, Å¿uch as we now weare, or rather Å¿uch as we hope for in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿urrection, I am not yet Å¿atisfied with my Å¿elf.</p>
            <pb n="54" facs="tcp:57273:40"/>
            <p>But concerning theÅ¿e myÅ¿te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, with the Å¿leep of <hi>Adam,</hi> and formation of <hi>Eve,</hi> they concern not the matter in hand.</p>
            <p>Into this body of <hi>Adam,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in all parts, God breathed the breath of life; by which breath, if we ingenuouÅ¿ly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare Scriptures, we muÅ¿t neceÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿arily underÅ¿tand the threefold life iÅ¿Å¿uing from the three fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Principles; to wit, The life of the Spirit, from the WiÅ¿dome; the life of the Soule, from the AbyÅ¿Å¿e; the life of the Body, from the Mundane Å¿pirit: by the mediation of all which, he is enabled to communicate with all the three Worlds. And although the life of the Spirit did (according to Gods juÅ¿t commination) fall aÅ¿leep in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi>

For as being carried in the chariot of the Worlds Å¿pirit with the five attendant SenÅ¿es, we view all its frame, and know its motions: Å¿o by our Soul we have a proÅ¿pect into the eternal AbyÅ¿Å¿e; and by the Spirit, into the magick glaÅ¿Å¿e of the WiÅ¿dom
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57273:41"/>and depth of the Deity: and herein is our dignity above the brute beaÅ¿ts, whoÅ¿e compoÅ¿ition participates onely of the laÅ¿t principle; we, beÅ¿ides that, of the firÅ¿t and Å¿econd.</p>
            <p>But if any man wonder that three Å¿uch noble and Å¿piritual EÅ¿Å¿ences Å¿hould croud themÅ¿elvs up into Å¿o mean and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a vehicle, and not preÅ¿Å¿e into freedome; let that man likewiÅ¿e conÅ¿ider and begin firÅ¿t to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Å¿uch a Å¿piritual and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacious eÅ¿Å¿ence as the Soul is by all Å¿uppoÅ¿ed to be, Å¿hould be coop'd in Å¿o pervious a cask as the Body is; and know, that that full-grown bulk is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionable to her greatnes, as this contemptible Epitome. And let this be a further anÅ¿wer:
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57273:41"/>
               <q>That the Spirit which out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tretched the branches of the muÅ¿tard-tree that our Saviour Å¿peaks of, in which the fowls of the aire made their neÅ¿ts, Å¿ate with as much elbow-room in that Å¿malleÅ¿t of Å¿eeds from whence that greateÅ¿t Å¿prung.</q>

            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:57273:42"/>
            <p>TheÅ¿e things premiÅ¿ed, and well weighed, it will not be difficult to determine either of the Creation or Traduction of Soules; when the terme and manner of both, well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tood, differ in no real concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For Å¿eeing we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Creation neither is, nor ever was from nothing; I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derÅ¿tand not why we may not affirm, that both Body and Soul were and are created by God, but of matter derived from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: But the Soul, not of that viÅ¿ible and Å¿enÅ¿ible, which the obtuÅ¿e beams of our SenÅ¿es can penetrate, but Å¿uch as diÅ¿appears from all material anatomy. Yet if any man Å¿hall think that theÅ¿e opinions in this are Å¿til at odds, in that an immediate creation
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57273:42"/>and infuÅ¿ion of the Å¿oul is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the one; The other builds it by the Å¿ame hand, but mediately and of Å¿econdary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials:</p>
            <p>This difference too will be eaÅ¿ily reconciled: for we affirm (and doubt not to an unbiaÅ¿s'd judgment to prove it) that both our bodies and Å¿oules do yet as immediately proceed from God as that of our firÅ¿t father <hi>Adam.</hi> A great illuÅ¿tration of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in hand, is that viÅ¿ion of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> of the dry bones timbred into bodies, and inÅ¿pired with life.

            <p>In this ViÅ¿ion is Å¿hadowed forth (though the primary Å¿cope was a thing different from both) not onely the ReÅ¿urrection,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57273:44"/>but the Creation alÅ¿o; though I conceive that the life of the Third Principle only activated theÅ¿e bones, which (the ViÅ¿ion ended) returned to its fountain: and as God out of them did cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate living men, and breathed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the breath of life by the miniÅ¿tration of the wind, and not his own mouth; Å¿o in the relation of the firÅ¿t forming of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Scripture puts Gods actions in the garment and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ture of humane, deÅ¿cending to our mean capacities, expreÅ¿Å¿ing Gods actions like ours: Not that it is to be imagined he Å¿tood over like a man tempering his clay, or kneading a piece of dough; into which being Å¿haped into a humane figure, he Å¿hould in a poÅ¿ture ridiculous for us to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57273:44"/>fancy, breathe life into his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trils; but 'tis rather probable, that as man by the mediation of the MicrocoÅ¿mick Å¿pirit inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Å¿eed caÅ¿t into the womb generates his like; Å¿o (God in like manner ordaining it) the Earth impregnated by the Å¿pirit of this world lodged in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hicle of the Elements and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Stars, brought forth a quinteÅ¿Å¿ence, which, nouriÅ¿hed in the womb of Å¿ome dark cave, grew in few houres to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect dimenÅ¿ions of a body: then, a Å¿pirit or wind blown from the lungs of the threefold World, animated its compleated mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, whereby at laÅ¿t the man broke through the dark entrails of the Earth, as a chicken its Å¿hel, or an infant the wombe of its mother.</p>
            <pb n="64" facs="tcp:57273:45"/>
            <p>And I doubt not at all, but that if Å¿ome young Scripling, unbiaÅ¿s'd by any forme or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, had been an eye-witneÅ¿Å¿e of <hi>Adam's</hi> birth, he would have deem'd him a meer Å¿on of the Earth, as not being able to reach that inviÅ¿ible Principle, that moves the groÅ¿Å¿e matter, and is the original of life.</p>
            <p>Since then, to affirm <hi>Adam</hi> to be created by God and inÅ¿pired by him, and withall to be framed out of the duÅ¿t and animated by the wind, are no repugnancies; <q>and what Å¿eems to us, or is recorded to be done by the mediation of viÅ¿ible Agents, is but Gods inward power diÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiÅ¿ed in a cloud:</q>

            <p>We conclude,

               <hi>That the Soule's Traduction from the Parents, and its Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation by God; are not onely either of them probable, but both true.</hi>
